        I am especially trained and experienced in Software development and have recently acquired new skills from TAFE Queensland. I hold a bachelor’s and a master’s degree in Information Technology and have gained over three years of valued experience in all aspects of software development, database design and implementation. Additionally, I also possess over eight years of management experiences.

        With my strong background in full stack development, I am passionate to indulge myself in new opportunities where I can put my knowledge and experience into action. My problem-solving, analytics, creativity and team-working skills have been commended by my peers and mentors. I am looking forward to innovative and challenging opportunities to bring the best out me.
